    stack
        A sequence of communication objects organized in a semi-linear sequence
        from the application layer at the top to the physical networking layer(s)
        at the bottom.

    discoverable
        Something that can be determined using a combination of BACnet objects,
        properties and services.  For example, discovering the network topology
        by using Who-Is-Router-To-Network, or knowing what objects are defined
        in a device by reading the *object-list* property.
